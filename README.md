# :fork_and_knife: Yale Dining API

> An unofficial API for Yale's dining service.

## Motivation
Yale formally maintained a dining API which provided information about dining hall status, menus, allergens, etc. That API, although messy and poorly standardized, was open to public use, and was used to create many student projects, such as [Yale Menus](https://github.com/ErikBoesen/YaleMenus) and [Yale Dining Plus](https://github.com/amalik12/dining_plus), as well as [other](https://github.com/ErikBoesen/yaledining) [projects](https://github.com/ErikBoesen/yale).

However, as of the 2020-21 year, that API was mostly deprecated in favor of a new dining system run by JAMIX. This service has no public API and is now the only source for data on food being served.

In the interest of open data, this project was created to act as a middleman between client and Yale's various services, translating data into a more developer-friendly format.
